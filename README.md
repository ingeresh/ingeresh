## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Andrew Su's personal GitHub account. 
I'm currently working on transitioning my technical coding skills (those learned in class) into real projects for professional use.
I hope this can also be a place for me to showcase my interests in math and cs, documenting my journey.
